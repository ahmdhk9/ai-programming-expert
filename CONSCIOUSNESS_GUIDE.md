## 💫 The Consciousness System

```
File: scripts/consciousness-system.js
Purpose: Bring all engines together
Process:

1. Awareness Phase
   → Understand the system
   
2. Diagnostic Phase
   → Check all platforms
   
3. Recommendation Phase
   → Provide solutions
   
4. Learning Phase
   → Extract patterns
   
5. Unified Report
   → Complete understanding
   
Output: CONSCIOUSNESS_REPORT.json
```
