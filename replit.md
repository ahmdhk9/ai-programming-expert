### User Preferences
Not specified in the original document.

### System Architecture
The platform is built as a fully independent system, capable of operating without reliance on external platforms like Replit, while maintaining direct and automatic synchronization with GitHub for code management.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Online Code Editor:** Features natural language command understanding (Arabic and English) and real-time live preview.
- **Unified Developer Panel:** A central dashboard (`/developer/unified-panel`) integrates various tools and AI chat.

**Technical Implementations & Feature Specifications:**
- **Development Tools:** Includes a secure GitHub connector (`/dev/connect-github`), online code editor (`/dev/editor/[projectId]`), live preview (`/dev/preview/[projectId]`), Replit IDE integration (`/developer/replit-ide`), and a dynamic builder (`/developer/dynamic-builder`).
- **Application Generation & Publishing:** Features an app generator (`/developer/app-generator`) and supports multi-store publishing (App Store, Google Play, etc.) with GitHub synchronization for continuous updates. Publishing stages are managed via `/dev/publishing-stages`.
- **Monetization System:**
    - **Earnings Dashboard:** (`/dev/dashboard-earnings`) provides instant profit calculations from multiple sources (in-app, ads, subscriptions).
    - **Smart Earnings Engine:** (`/dev/smart-earnings`) utilizes AI for intelligent analysis, potential profit calculation, growth recommendations, and accurate future predictions.
    - **Payment & Subscription Engine:** Supports multiple payment gateways (Stripe, PayPal), recurring subscriptions (`/dev/subscriptions-engine`), and a referral program (`/dev/referral-marketing`).
    - **Smart Cryptocurrency System:** Features auto-generated private cryptocurrencies, smart autonomous wallets (`/dev/crypto-wallet`), and automated earnings through staking, farming, arbitrage, and lending. It integrates with global platforms like Binance, Ethereum, and Polygon.
- **Security & Internet Access:** Includes a web analyzer (`/dev/web-analyzer`) for vulnerability scanning, a search engine (`/dev/search-engine`), DDoS protection, and link analysis. Security is enhanced with military-grade AES-256 encryption and a smart firewall.
- **Self-Growth & Research:** The platform incorporates continuous AI-driven research for new opportunities, automatic generation of micro-projects (books, apps, games, courses), smart partnership discovery, server optimization, and strategies for global expansion (`/dev/auto-growth`).
- **Promotional System:** A dual-mode promotional engine (`/dev/marketing-engine`) supports both "hidden" (stealth, owner-only tracking) and "viral" (public campaigns, community-driven) marketing strategies.
- **Global Integrations:** Seamless integration with 12 global platforms, including social media (Telegram, Snapchat, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp, Discord), video platforms (YouTube, Twitch), and e-commerce/marketing platforms (Amazon Affiliate, Google Ads, E-commerce, Affiliate Programs). These integrations contribute to automated revenue generation.
